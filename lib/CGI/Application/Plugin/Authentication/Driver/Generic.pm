=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Driver::Generic - Generic Authentication driver


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use base qw(CGI::Application);
 use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication;

  __PACKAGE__->authen->config(
        DRIVER => [ 'Generic', { user1 => '123', user2 => '123' } ],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Driver offers a simple way to provide a user database to the
L<CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication> plugin.  It offers three ways
to provide a list of users to the plugin by providing a hash of username/password pairs,
an array of arrays containing the username and password pairs, or a code
reference that returns back the username, or undef on success or failure.

=head1 EXAMPLE

  my %users = (
    user1 => '123',
    user2 => '123',
  );
  __PACKAGE__->authen->config(
        DRIVER => [ 'Generic', \%users ],
  );

  - or -

  my @users = (
    ['example.com', 'user1', '123'],
    ['example.com', 'user2', '123'],
    ['foobar.com', 'user1', '123'],
  );
  __PACKAGE__->authen->config(
        DRIVER => [ 'Generic', \@users ],
        CREDENTIALS => [ 'authen_domain', 'authen_username', 'authen_password' ]
  );

  - or -

  sub check_password {
    my @credentials = @_;
    if ($credentials[0] eq 'test' && $credentials[1] eq 'secret') {
        return 'testuser';
    }
    return;
  }

  __PACKAGE__->authen->config(
        DRIVER => [ 'Generic', \&check_password ],
  );


=head1 METHODS

=head2 verify_credentials

This method will test the provided credentials against either the hash ref, array ref or code ref
that the driver was configured with.

        return ( defined $data->{ $creds[0] } && $data->{ $creds[0] } eq $creds[1] ) ? $creds[0] : undef;
    } elsif ( ref $data eq 'ARRAY' ) {
        foreach my $row (@$data) {
            return $creds[0] unless grep { !defined $creds[$_] || $creds[$_] ne $row->[$_] } 0..$#$row;
        }
        return undef;
    } elsif ( ref $data eq 'CODE' ) {
