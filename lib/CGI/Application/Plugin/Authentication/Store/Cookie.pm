=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store::Cookie - Cookie based Store


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use base qw(CGI::Application);
 use CGI::Application::Plugin::Session;
 use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication;

  __PACKAGE__->authen->config(
        STORE => ['Cookie', SECRET => "Shhh, don't tell anyone", NAME => 'CAPAUTH_DATA', EXPIRY => '+1y'],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module uses a cookie to store authentication information across multiple requests.
It works by creating a cookie that contains the information we would like to store (like
the name of the user that is currently authenticated), and then base64 encoding
the data.  In order to ensure that the information is not manipulated by the end-user, we include
a CRC checksum that is generated along with our secret.  Since the user does not know the value
of the secret, they will not be able to recreate the checksum if they change some of the values, so we
will be able to tell if the information in the cookie has been manipulated.

=head1 THE SECRET

=head2 Choosing a good secret

An easy way to generate a relatively good secret is to run the following perl snippet:

  perl -MDigest::MD5=md5_base64 -l -e 'print md5_base64($$,time(),rand(9999))'

Just use the resulting string as your secret.

=head2 Configuring the secret

There are three ways that you can provide a secret to the module:

=over 4

=item Hardcode the secret

You can hardcode a secret right in the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store::Cookie module,
so that you don't have to remember to provide one every time you use the module.  Just open the
source in a text editor and look at the top of the file where it defines 'our $SECRET' and follow
the instruction listed there.

=item Provide the SECRET option when using the module

You can also just provide the secret as an option when using the module using the SECRET
parameter.

  __PACKAGE__->authen->config(
        STORE => ['Cookie', SECRET => "Shhh, don't tell anyone"],
  );

=item Let the module choose a secret for you

And lastly, if you forget to do either of these, the module will use the name of your application
as the secret, but that is not a very good value to use, so a warning will be spit out everytime
it uses this.  This is the least desirable choice, and is only included as a last resort.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 fetch

This method accepts a list of parameters and fetches them from the cookie data.

=cut

sub fetch {
    my $self = shift;
    my @items = map { $self->{cookie}->{data}->{$_} } @_;
    return @items[0..$#items];
}

=head2 save

This method accepts a hash of parameters and values and stores them in the cookie data.

=cut

sub save {
    my $self = shift;
    my %items = @_;
    while (my ($param, $value) = each %items) {
        $self->{cookie}->{data}->{$param} = $value;
    }
    $self->_register_postrun_callback;
    return 1;
}

=head2 delete

This method accepts a list of parameters and deletes them from the cookie data.

=cut

sub delete {
    my $self = shift;
    foreach my $param (@_) {
        delete $self->{cookie}->{data}->{$param};
    }
    $self->_register_postrun_callback;
    return 1;
}

=head2 initialize

This method will check for an existing cookie, and decode the contents for later retrieval.

=cut

sub initialize {
    my $self = shift;

    # Check for CGI::Cookie
    die "CGI::Cookie is required to use the Cookie store" unless CGI::Cookie->require;

    # Check for MIME::Base64
    die "MIME::Base64 is required to use the Cookie store" unless MIME::Base64->require;

    # Check for Digest::SHA1
    die "Digest::SHA1 is required to use the Cookie store" unless Digest::SHA1->require;

    my @options = $self->options;
    die "Invalid Store Configuration for the Cookie store - options section must contain a hash of values" if @options % 2;
    my %options = @options;
    $self->{cookie}->{options} = \%options;

    my %cookies = CGI::Cookie->fetch;
    if ($cookies{$self->cookie_name}) {
        my $rawdata = $cookies{$self->cookie_name}->value;
        $self->{cookie}->{data} = $self->_decode($rawdata);
    }
#    $self->_register_postrun_callback;

    return;
}

=head2 cookie_name

This method will return the name of the cookie

=cut

sub cookie_name {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{cookie}->{options}->{NAME} || 'CAPAUTH_DATA';
}
