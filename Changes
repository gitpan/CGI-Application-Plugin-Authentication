Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Application::Plugin::Auth.

0.04  Thu Sep 22 21:06:54 EDT 2005

    API Changes
    - renamed 'encoders' to 'filters' - This should only affect
      driver writers and not end users

    New Stuff
    - filters (formerly encoders) can now be chained (See docs)
    - filters can take a param (See docs)
    - added filters for uc, lc and trim
    - added a simple sample application
    - more docs (based on suggestions from Ron Savage)


0.03  Mon Sep 19 14:57:47 EDT 2005

    API Changes
    - renamed the 'auth' method to 'authen' to make it easier
      to distinguish from the upcoming 'authz' plugin.  There
      is also an alias to 'authentication' for those who like
      clarity over brevity.
    - For the DBI driver, changed credential identifiers from
      cred_1 to __CREDENTIAL_1__

    New Drivers
    - Dummy Driver - accepts any credentials as valid

    New Stuff
    - Added little icons to the default login and password
      fields (only works in Mozilla based browsers)
    - if STORE config is not given, the plugin will detect if
      you are already using the Session plugin, and use the
      Session Store instead of the Cookie Store.
    - Added a lot of new documentation

    Bug Fixes
    - 'run_modes' method was incorrectly being used in the
      test suite (reported by Ron Savage)

    New Drivers
    - DBI Driver

    New Stores
    - Cookie store (requires no server side storage)

    New Stuff
    - Added field encoding support for datastores that
      keep passwords in an encoded format, like Unix crypt,
      or MD5.
    - Added encoders for crypt, MD5 and SHA1
    - Added some more methods to Driver.pm that can simplify
      the building of new Driver modules (find_option, encode,
      check_encoded, strip_field_names)
    - Added lots more tests to the test suite
      (Cees and Shawn Sorichetti)

    Bug Fixes
    - Fixed Generic Driver when using array of arrays method.
    - Options no longer get clobbered by the modules.
